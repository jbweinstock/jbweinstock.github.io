<p style="font-size:16px; ">I am currently a PhD candidate in Biological Oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, and I seek to understand how the timing of life cycle events interacts with environmental variability and climate change to mediate larval dispersal and population connectivity of coastal marine species. I first became interested in scientific research through <span class="highlight">geology courses at Smith College</span> and <span class="highlight">summer internships in marine ecology at UMass Boston and the Downeast Institute (DEI)</span>. I completed a <span class="highlight">B.A. in Geoscience</span> in 2016 with a minor in marine biology, and after graduating I returned to DEI to work as a research assistant. In 2017, I undertook a <span class="highlight">Fulbright Fellowship at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute</span> in Bocas del Toro, Panama, where I quantified the impacts of seasonal hypoxia on holo- and mero-planktonic communities. I continued sample processing and data analysis through 2018, while also working part-time as a high school math and science tutor. I have been a PhD student in the Joint Program since summer 2019, and I will be finishing up this winter.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; ">Throughout these experiences, I have participated in geology and marine biology research programs in the <span class="highlight">United States (Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, and California), northeast Canada, New Zealand, and Panama,</span> and I have worked with adults and/or larvae of taxonomic groups including <span class="highlight">bivalves, barnacles, echinoderms, gastropods, crabs, shrimp, and parasitic isopods.</span></p>

<p style="font-size:16px; ">I am also working with Kharis Schrage (fellow Joint Program graduate student and larval enthusiast) to <span class="highlight">revive the International Larval Biology Symposium,</span> a semi-regular academic conference focused on all things larvae.
