I am a marine ecologist, interested in the factors that affect the timing of invertebrate reproduction and how that timing, in turn, impacts larval dispersal and population connectivity. I am currently a *PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program* in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science & Engineering, studying these processes in intertidal barnacles using *timeseries measurements of local populations, satellite observations of surface temperatures and currents,* and *population genomics of both adult barnacles and larvae.* I do the bulk of my work in R (data cleaning, processing, plotting, analyzing), but I also dabble in bash and matlab.
