<p style="font-size:16px; ">I am a marine ecologist, interested in the factors that affect the timing of invertebrate reproduction and how that timing, in turn, impacts larval dispersal and population connectivity. I am currently a <b>PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program</b> in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science & Engineering, studying these processes in intertidal barnacles using <b>timeseries measurements of local populations, satellite observations of surface temperatures and currents,</b> and <b>population genomics of both adult barnacles and larvae.</b> I do the bulk of my work in R (data cleaning, processing, plotting, analyzing), but I also dabble in bash and matlab.</p>
